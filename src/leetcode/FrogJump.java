/**
 * A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each unit there may or may
 * not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.
 * 
 * Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog is
 * able to cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone
 * and assume the first jump must be 1 unit.
 * 
 * If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units.
 * Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The number of stones is â‰¥ 2 and is < 1,100.
 * 
 * Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 231.
 * 
 * The first stone's position is always 0.

	 * Use map to represent a mapping from the stone (not index) to the steps that can be taken from

	 * Notice that no need to calculate the last stone.
	 * 
	 * On each step, we look if any other stone can be reached from it, if so, we update that
	 * stone's steps by adding step, step + 1, step - 1. If we can reach the final stone, we return
	 * true. No need to calculate to the last stone.
